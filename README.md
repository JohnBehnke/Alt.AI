# Alt.AI

Alt.AI is a little toy utility for generating alt text for a given image using OpenAI's Vision model. It'll give you rough estimates for token cost. You'll need to bring your own API key. 

**Note** I haven't touched this for a while, so it may be using an older and more expensive vision model.
